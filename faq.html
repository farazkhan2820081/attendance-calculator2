                <h2>General Questions</h2>

                <h3>What is the 75% attendance rule?</h3>
                <p>The 75% attendance rule is a common academic policy requiring students to attend at least 75% of their classes to be eligible for final examinations. This means out of 100 classes, you must attend at least 75 classes to meet the minimum requirement.</p>

                <h3>How do I calculate my attendance percentage?</h3>
                <p>To calculate attendance percentage, use this formula: (Classes Attended ÷ Total Classes) × 100. For example, if you attended 45 out of 60 classes, your attendance percentage would be (45 ÷ 60) × 100 = 75%.</p>

                <h3>Are these tools free to use?</h3>
                <p>Yes! All our attendance calculation tools are completely free to use. We don't require registration or charge any fees.</p>

                <h3>Do you store my attendance data?</h3>
                <p>No, we don't store any of your personal attendance data. All calculations are performed locally in your browser, ensuring your privacy.</p>

                <h2>Tool-Specific Questions</h2>

                <h3>Can I use these tools for multiple subjects?</h3>
                <p>Yes! Our <a href="/class-attendance-tracker.html">Class Attendance Tracker</a> is specifically designed to help you monitor attendance across multiple subjects simultaneously and calculates your overall attendance percentage.</p>

                <h3>What's the difference between the Required Attendance Calculator and Bunk Calculator?</h3>
                <p>The <a href="/required-attendance-calculator.html">Required Attendance Calculator</a> tells you how many classes you need to attend to reach a target percentage, while the <a href="/bunk-calculator.html">Bunk Calculator</a> tells you how many classes you can skip while maintaining your minimum required percentage.</p>

                <h3>How accurate are the calculations?</h3>
                <p>Our calculations are mathematically precise and based on standard attendance formulas used by educational institutions worldwide. The results are rounded to appropriate decimal places for practical use.</p>

                <h2>Academic Policies</h2>

                <h3>Do all institutions follow the 75% rule?</h3>
                <p>While 75% is the most common requirement, different institutions may have varying policies. Some require 80% or 85% attendance. Always check your specific institution's attendance policy.</p>

                <h3>What happens if I don't meet the minimum attendance?</h3>
                <p>Consequences vary by institution but may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ineligibility for final examinations</li>
                    <li>Automatic course failure</li>
                    <li>Requirement to repeat the course</li>
                    <li>Academic probation</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Can medical leave affect my attendance?</h3>
                <p>Most institutions have provisions for medical leave that may not count against your attendance. However, policies vary, so check with your academic office for specific guidelines.</p>

                <h2>Technical Questions</h2>

                <h2>Usage Tips</h2>

                <h3>How often should I check my attendance?</h3>
                <p>We recommend checking your attendance percentage weekly or after each class to stay on top of your academic requirements and plan accordingly.</p>

                <h3>What if I get different results from my institution's system?</h3>
                <p>Minor differences can occur due to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Different rounding methods</li>
                    <li>Institutional policies on partial attendance</li>
                    <li>Exclusion of certain class types</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Always refer to your institution's official attendance records for final verification.</p>
